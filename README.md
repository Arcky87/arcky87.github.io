Based on Creative Theme v7.0.7 and Bootstrap v5.2.3.



Creating a site with this particular Jekyll theme, is basically writing a markdown site.

- Start by adding your info in `_config.yml`.
- Don't forget to change `_data/footer.yml` to update the copyright.
- In `index.md` reorder or remove section as you prefer.
- You can also add other pages, like `links.md`.
- Edit `_data/menus.yml` to add links in the navigation bar.
